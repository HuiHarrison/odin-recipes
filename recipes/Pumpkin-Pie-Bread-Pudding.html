    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Combination of 2 classic recipes: bread pudding and pumpkin pie. I put this together on a whim and loved it. Taste is more comforting than sweet. Great served warm or cold and can be complemented with whipped cream or milk.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 loaf French bread, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins, <em>or more to taste</em></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon maple-flavored extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon rum-flavored extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup water, <em>or as needed</em></li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk <em>(such as Eagle Brand®)</em></li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons molasses</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spread bread cubes into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix raisins, maple-flavored extract, and rum-flavored extract together in a bowl; pour in enough water to almost cover raisins. Heat raisin mixture in microwave until raisins are plump, about 1 1/2 minutes; set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Beat milk, pumpkin puree, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, raisin mixture, brown sugar, butter, molasses, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, allspice, and ginger together in a large bowl until smooth; pour over bread. Set mixture aside until bread has absorbed the liquid, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
